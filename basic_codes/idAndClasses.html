    <h2>This is Our Ids and Classes Tutorial</h2>


    <!-- we can give id to single element in a page. it is like the aadhar number of a person. one element has only one id while it has any number of Classes -->
    <!-- we can add as much classes as we want by giving space -->
    <div id="mainBox" class = "redBg blackBg"></div> 


    <!-- .tagClass_name is used to write class and #tagId_name for id
    if we want to write this n number of times then we write it as .tagClass_name*n for class and  #tagId_name*n for id 
    if we want to write multiple class then we can use shortcut as .tagClass_name.class_name2.class_name3 and so on
    emmet takes div as default -->
